             <p><i>I have joint a coop event at Bachok during Smk in which i am Form 5 at that time. The event taught me to be a successful bussinesswoman. At first, i taught it just an event to diciplined us during selling at the coop. Eventually, at that time it has taught us to manage all the internal and external factor in business and also know how the financial, operation, human resources and marketing manager works. Plus i also experienced how to interact and communicated with people due to our bussiness engagement. Start from that, i know what i love to and what i will work on to. Here i am now studying in marketing course. </i></p>
